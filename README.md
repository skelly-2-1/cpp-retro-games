# Notes
* This is developed in Visual Studio Code. I've included my own .vscode directory, which may not work for you
* To change the target platform to build and test, change PLATFORM_X to PLATFORM_WINDOWS/LINUX/NS in .vscode/c_cpp_properties.json
* Only 16:9 resolutions are supported at the moment. I'll look into changing that in the future.
* The emscripten (web) version of this is available at https://skelly-2-1.github.io/cpp-retro-games/cpp-retro-games.html
